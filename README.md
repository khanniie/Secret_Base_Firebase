# Secret_Base_Firebase

YOU WILL NEED TO FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCITONS TO SET UP FIREBASE
https://firebase.google.com/docs/unity/setup

USE THESE TO START IF NEEDED:
https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-unity

I think for most people, the files you should be looking at are UAuth and Dbase. I cut a lot of corners in my code for the sake of time, but an actually good implementation is done in the firebase quickstart unity files linked above. 

The Vuforia stuff is pretty normal.

I had some issues with firebase, but I documented the fixes here: http://cmuems.com/2018/60212s/conye/04/06/conye-artech/

Good luck! :)
